Create a modern full-stack trading signal admin panel with the following specifications:

Frontend:

Use Next.js (latest version) framework.

Use shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a highly customizable, accessible, and modern UI design.

Implement core pages: Dashboard, Trading Signals, Manage Users, Historical Data, and Feature Toggles (enable/disable sections).

Use advanced React table components with sorting, filtering, pagination, real-time updates, and CSV export features.

Include interactive trading charts using Recharts or Plotly.js.

Implement real-time data fetching and synchronization with React Query or SWR and WebSocket or SSE support.

Integrate role-based access control and JWT or OAuth2 authentication for security.

Backend:

Use Flask or FastAPI for building RESTful HTTP and WebSocket/SSE APIs.

Use SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL for robust, scalable database management.

Provide APIs for user management, CRUD operations on trading signals, historical data access.

Implement WebSocket(SSE) endpoints for pushing live trading signals and updates.

Secure APIs with JWT/OAuth2, validate inputs rigorously, and maintain detailed logs and audit records.

File Structure Recommendation (Monorepo style without Docker):

Development & Deployment Guidance:

Use environment variables for storing secrets and config parameters.

Implement unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend using Jest and Pytest respectively.

Provide clear README instructions for installation, setup, running dev servers, and API usage.

Keep the frontend and backend loosely coupled with well-defined API contracts.

This structured, modern approach ensures maintainability, scalability, and clarity without Docker, making local development and next-phase deployment straightforward. It balances real-time functionality, data handling, security, and a modern UI perfectly suited for trading signal admin panels.
